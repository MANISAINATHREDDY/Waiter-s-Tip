# Waiter's Tip Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that predicts the tip amount a restaurant customer is likely to leave, based on features such as total bill, time of day, day of week, and party size.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MANISAINATHREDDY/waiters-tip-prediction.git
cd waiters-tip-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook Waiters_Tip_Prediction.ipynb
```

## Project Steps

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preprocessing & Outlier Removal
- Categorical Encoding and Feature Scaling
- Model Training (Linear Regression, XGBRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor)
- Evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Best Model

RandomForestRegressor achieved the lowest MAE on the validation set.
